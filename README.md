## Get Involved

We're on a mission to make **Namingo** the best it can be, and we need your expertise! Whether you're adept in development, have a keen eye for design, or simply brim with innovative ideas, your contribution can make a world of difference.

### Current Status:

- **WHOIS and DAS Servers**: These servers are almost ready to go! They are functional but require additional testing and security hardening to ensure reliability and safety.
  
- **EPP Server**: All primary commands including Check, Create, Info, Poll, Delete, Renew, Update, and Transfer are now added. We're currently refining and testing these features for optimal performance. Extensions like RGP and SecDNS will be available soon. As always, our focus is on security and quality.
  
- **RDAP Server**: Nearing completion. The primary focus is on formatting more data for the output. Like the others, it also requires further testing and security hardening.
  
- **Automation Scripts**: These scripts are at varying stages of development. While some are ready, they need in-depth logic testing to ensure their efficiency and accuracy.
  
- **Control Panel**: This is our most nascent component. Development is underway, and there's ample opportunity for contributors to shape its direction and functionality.

Feel free to dive into our issues to see where you can help or reach out to us directly to discuss how you can contribute.
