Open-source domain registry platform. Revolutionizing ccTLD and gTLD management with Namingo.

## Introduction

Namingo is a state-of-the-art open-source domain registry platform, diligently crafted to serve ccTLD, gTLD, brand and private domain registries. Written from scratch in 2023, it adheres to the latest standards, ensuring a cutting-edge experience.

## Get Involved

We're on a mission to make **Namingo** the best it can be, and we need your expertise! Whether you're adept in development, have a keen eye for design, or simply brim with innovative ideas, your contribution can make a world of difference.

### Current Status:

Namingo is rapidly approaching its full launch, with key system components, including the WHOIS, DAS, EPP, and RDAP servers, already implemented and fully operational. These components, along with our control panel, have successfully passed basic security and penetration testing, ensuring a robust and secure experience for our users.

We are now in the process of finalizing the control panel, aiming to refine its features and user interface. If you have expertise in detailed testing and optimization, your contribution would be highly valued. Please consider reaching out to us for this crucial phase.

In terms of system performance, Namingo has been tested with up to 150,000 domains and runs efficiently on a VPS with 2 cores, 4GB of RAM, and a 100GB SSD. Additionally, this volume of domains occupies just a bit more than 1 GB in the database.

Our development efforts are currently focused on:

- Integrating support for the fee extension (RFC8748).

- Implementing the launch phase extension (RFC8334).

- Adding support for the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH).

We welcome developers and contributors to explore our issues for opportunities to help, or to contact us directly to discuss how you can contribute to the success of Namingo.
