# Namingo Registry
Open-source domain registry platform. Revolutionizing ccTLD and gTLD management with Namingo.

## Introduction

Namingo is a state-of-the-art open-source domain registry platform, diligently crafted to serve ccTLD and gTLD domain registries, brand registries, and ICANN accredited registrars. It's a fusion of innovation and imagination, designed to be more than a tool; it's a vision of a world where names breathe, sing, and resonate with meaning.

Though we're still spreading our wings, our commitment to excellence ensures that Namingo is on an evolutionary journey. Gradually, we are expanding our capabilities, and before the launch of our first full version, support for a comprehensive range of services will be seamlessly integrated.
