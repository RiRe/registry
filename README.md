# Namingo Registry
Open-source domain registry platform. Revolutionizing ccTLD and gTLD management with Namingo.

## Introduction

Namingo is a state-of-the-art open-source domain registry and registrar platform, diligently crafted to serve ccTLD and gTLD domain registries, brand registries, and ICANN accredited registrars. Inspired by XPanel Registry (https://github.com/XPanel/epp), Namingo incorporates certain elements and parts of the code from XPanel and has been significantly rewritten. It's a fusion of innovation and imagination, designed to be more than a tool; it's a vision of a world where names breathe, sing, and resonate with meaning.

Though we're still spreading our wings, our commitment to excellence ensures that Namingo is on an evolutionary journey. Gradually, we are expanding our capabilities, and before the launch of our first full version, support for a comprehensive range of services will be seamlessly integrated.

Fully primed to support gTLDs for the next ICANN application round, Namingo stands at the forefront of domain innovation, ready to embrace the next wave of digital transformation.

## Get Involved

We are actively looking for help and contributors to make Namingo even better! Whether you're a developer, designer, or just someone with great ideas, we would love to have you on board. Check out our issues or feel free to reach out to us directly.
