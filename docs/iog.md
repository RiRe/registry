# Initial Operation Guide (IOG)

Welcome to the Initial Operation Guide for Namingo. This document is designed to assist you in the initial setup and operation of your Namingo system. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth start and efficient management of your domain registry.

## Logging into the Control Panel

1. **Access the Panel**: Begin by logging in to the control panel as the registry administrator. This is the user account you created during the installation process.
2. **Familiarize Yourself**: Once logged in, take some time to explore the interface and familiarize yourself with the various features and settings available.
3. **Test the System**: Try creating a contact in the system, and then using this contact to register a domain under one of your test TLDs. This practical exercise allows you to experience the end-to-end process of domain registration as your registrars would. After registering the domain, make use of the WHOIS and RDAP services to verify the domain's addition to the system. This process not only familiarizes you with Namingo's functionality but also ensures that all components of your registry are functioning as expected. It's an excellent way to validate your setup and prepare for managing live domain registrations.

## Configuring Your Registry

1. **Navigate to Registry Configuration**: In the control panel, go to the `registry-configuration` menu.
2. **Set Up Registry Details**: Here, you will configure essential details such as:
    - **Registry Operator Name**: The official name of your registry.
    - **Registry Handle**: A unique identifier for your registry.
    - **WHOIS/RDAP Server URLs**: The URLs for your WHOIS and RDAP servers.
    - **Registry VAT/Company Number**: Your registry's tax or company identification number.
    - **Registry Contact Information**: Address, email, and phone number for registry contact.
    - **Launch Phase Extension**: Decide whether to enable the launch phase extension feature.

## Adding Top-Level Domains (TLDs)

1. **Go to Registry TLDs Menu**: In the control panel, select the `registry-TLDs` menu.
2. **Add Your TLD**: You can add a new TLD by specifying details such as:
    - **Extension**: The TLD extension (e.g., .com, .org).
    - **Type**: Whether it's a ccTLD or gTLD.
    - **Supported Script**: The script types supported by the TLD.
    - **Pricing**: Set prices for registration and renewal.
    - **Premium Names**: Define any premium domain names.
3. **Manage Reserved Names**: In this section, you can also manage names that are reserved and not available for general registration.
4. **Deleting Test TLDs**: Currently, test TLDs can only be removed directly from the database. For this, please contact the Namingo support team for assistance.

## Managing Registrars

1. **Create a Registrar**: Navigate to the `registrars` section and choose to create a new registrar.
2. **Add Your First Registrar**: Fill in the required details to add your first registrar to the system.
3. **Deleting Registrars**: Similar to test TLDs, registrars can currently only be deleted via the database. Contact the Namingo support team for any such requests.
